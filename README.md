# iw4xSniper
IW4x is a modification for Modern Warfare 2 built on top of a decentralized network of dedicated servers. iw4xSniper is a custom gamemode for IW4x that only allows snipers.
The mod is written in Activision's gsc language, which is similar to C.

## Motivation
This project was created due to the lack of a quick-paced sniping mod in iw4x.

## Installation
Extract the zip file and copy the sniper folder to ../PathToGame/mods/

## Contributors
Special thanks to Santahunter for contributing code to this project. I also want to recognize tccr and raidmax for helping me with iw4x related issues.
