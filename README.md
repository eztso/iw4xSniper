# iw4xSniper
IW4x is a modification for Modern Warfare 2 built on top of a decentralized network of dedicated servers. iw4xSniper is a custom gamemode for IW4x that restricts weapons snipers.
Other improvements include changes to movespeed and crosshair accuracy.
The mod is written in Activision's gsc language, which is similar to C.


## Installation
Extract the zip file and copy the sniper folder to ../PathToGame/mods/
